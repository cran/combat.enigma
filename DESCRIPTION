Description: Fit and apply ComBat, linear mixed-effects models (LMM), or prescaling to harmonize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from different sites. Briefly, these methods remove differences between sites due to using different scanning devices, and LMM additionally tests linear hypotheses. As detailed in the manual, the original ComBat function was first modified for the harmonization of MRI data (Fortin et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.024>) and then modified again to create separate functions for fitting and applying the harmonization and allow missing values and constant rows for its use within the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium (Radua et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116956>); this package includes the latter version. LMM calls "lme" massively considering specific brain imaging details. Finally, prescaling is a good option for fMRI, where different devices can have varying units of measurement.
